/**
 * Canonical mapping for games published on progamestore.online.
 *
 * Most games follow the convention `app_id` → CF Pages project `free<id>app`,
 * which is what we infer when an entry isn't here. The CF Pages project name
 * is NOT renameable after creation, so non-conventional projects need an
 * override entry below.
 *
 * Same naming convention as fas-cli's APPS map (intentional — both stores
 * deploy through the same Cloudflare account, so project namespaces overlap
 * and most projects follow `free<id>app`). The DIFFERENCE is the subdomain
 * — games live under `*.progamestore.online`. Previously this file was a
 * verbatim copy of fas-cli/src/lib/apps.ts and silently routed `fgs logs` /
 * `fgs publish` / `fgs list` at the wrong store.
 *
 * Long-term this should fetch the storefront's registry.json at runtime so
 * adding a new non-conventional game doesn't require a CLI bump. For now,
 * keep the override list small — convention-following games don't need
 * entries.
